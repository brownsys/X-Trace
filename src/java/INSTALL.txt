X-Trace Java Distribution 2.1
=============================

X-Trace is a self-contained package; it doesn't need root or admininstrator
privileges and doesn't require installation into a system directory. If you
want to make it more easily accessible or make the proxy run as a service, take
a look at the scripts in bin. The distribution doesn't do this at this point.

From GitHub
-----------

If you downloaded X-Trace from GitHub, you can build it from the source using
Maven. Let <xtrace> be the directory of the repository.

$ cd <xtrace>/src/java
$ mvn package appassembler:assemble

The JAR will be generated in <xtrace>/java/src/target. You can now run the
X-Trace backend (check that you have all necessary dependencies, see
Dependencies below).

$ cd <xtrace>/src/java
$ bin/backend.sh

You can also build the documentation with:

$ mvn site

The documentation will be in <xtrace>/src/java/target/site.

From the release file
---------------------

If you obtained a release file, x-trace-2.0-<date>.tar.gz or .zip, extract it
to your directory of choice (which we'll call <xtrace> for our example below).
Run the backend with the following:

$ bin/backend.sh

Once the backend is running, the X-Trace reporting interface can be accessed by
visiting http://localhost:4080.

Dependencies
------------

All of the dependencies to run X-Trace are included in the distribution. For
visualizing the results you will need a recent version of Graphviz. You will
also need to have Java 1.5, Maven, Ruby, and Perl.

To use the Thrift client and server, you will need Apache Thrift 0.8.0.
Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include thrift if you want to use the C++ client.

For the visualization, you will need a Browser that can run Java Applets,
and Perl LWP::Simple.
