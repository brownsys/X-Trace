<!--  XTrace client configuration file   

Use this as a template to write your X-Trace configuration

Configuration files are found via Java's Classpath.  Only the first instance of each file is used.
For example, in Hadoop, the $HADOOP_CONF_DIR is added by the hadoop launch scripts to the front of
the path, so that is the most appropriate place to put your XTrace configuration.

Valid Configuration tags:
<XTrace> Specifies whether X-Trace is enabled at all.  Values: Enabled, Disabled
<Filters> Specifies the logging classes which are enabled by X-Trace

Valid Filters tags:
<Default> The default action for all classes  Values: Enabled, Disabled
<Enabled> Enable a class for logging.  This value supercedes the value in the Default tag.  Values: a fully qualified java class, eg. edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceContext
<Disabled> Disable a class for logging.  This value supercedes the value in the Default tag.  Values: a fully qualified java class, eg. edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceContext
